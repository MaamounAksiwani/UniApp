                    >Medicine is one of the most respected and most rewarding
                    professions in the world. One of the top destinations to
                    study the subject of medicine is Germany as it has one of
                    the best healthcare systems in the world and the demand for
                    physicians after you graduate from a program in Germany is
                    high. Universities in Germany also rank among the top
                    schools to study medicine in not only Europe but the entire
                    world. For example, in the ranking list for the top 50
                    medical universities in Europe, 12 of the 50 universities
                    listed are German universities. This is why it’s a great
                    option to study medicine in Germany.</span

                    >This stage of medical studies takes 6 years to be
                    completed. The first two of the years are the stage 1
                    pre-clinic studies (in German: Vorklinik). In this stage,
                    students learn the theoretical basics of medicine like
                    anatomy, biochemistry and psychology among other topics.
                    They also take a three months internship working as a nurse.
                    After this is completed, they sit for the first part of
                    their medical physician’s examination (often called the
                    “Physikum”. In German: Abschnitt der ärztlichen Prüfung
                    1).&nbsp;</span

                    German: Klinik). This stage takes 3 years to be completed.
                    Students start learning more in-depth medical topics like
                    specialised areas like neurology, gynaecology, and
                    paediatrics, among others. They also undertake a 4 month
                    long internship in a hospital or GP office (in German:
                    Famulatur). After this stage, students take the second part
                    of their medical examination (in German: Abschnitt der
                    ärztlichen Prüfung 2).</span

                    practical year (German: Praktisches Jahr). After this year,
                    they sit for the last part of their physician’s exam (the
                    state exam). When students are done with all 3 parts of the
                    exam, they obtain their license to practice as physicians in
                    Germany.&nbsp;</span

                    medical students. They take 2 to 6 semesters (1 to 3 years)
                    to be completed, within which students write a doctoral
                    medical thesis. This study may be carried out in parallel to
                    university studies or residency. In this stage, students
                    write their own dissertation that averages on 100 pages.
                    When they hand in their doctorate thesis, they can be called
                    Doctor of Medicine or M.D.&nbsp;</span

                    medical field. This training takes up to 6 years to be
                    completed. When students have passed a specialist medical
                    exam, they can open their own clinic. Without this stage,
                    doctors can only treat patients who are privately insured or
                    work in medical or health science fields where they don’t
                    medically treat patients.</span

                    students to obtain a specialist position after graduation
                    from the program. They can also decide to freely specialize
                    in a certain medical field in a hospital, a process that is
                    easier than in many other countries. Because of the high
                    demand for physicians in Germany, they can almost guarantee
