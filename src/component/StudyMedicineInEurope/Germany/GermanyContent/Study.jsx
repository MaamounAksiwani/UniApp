                      cheaper to study there than to study in other top study
                      destinations like the United States, Australia, Canada or
                      the United Kingdom. For most public universities in
                      Germany, you’ll only need to pay a semester fee when
                      studying medicine. Living costs in Germany are also
                      cheaper than in many other countries. If you are a
                      postgraduate student, you can also work at a hospital
                      whilst studying, making an average of 4,500 euros a month
                      and not paying any tuition fees.&nbsp;</span

                      world, with state-of-the-art medical technology. They are
                      also ranked globally as some of the best hospitals. The
                      public health system offers many great services for people
                      who can’t afford private health insurance and they could
                      also subsidize procedures for them. German medical

                      with generous scholarship packages for international
                      students who choose to study there. This helps students
                      save up money while they are attending university studies,
                      especially with the minimal tuition fees.&nbsp;</span

                      This means it’ll be easy for you to find a job after
                      graduation to work in Germany. There is a lower percentage
                      of doctors in Germany than in other countries that are
                      neighbouring which means that finding a job is pretty easy
                      than if you were studying in another country.&nbsp;</span
