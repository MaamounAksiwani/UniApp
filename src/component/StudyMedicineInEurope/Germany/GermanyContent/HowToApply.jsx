                    people to study medicine in Germany due to shortages of
                    doctors, especially in rural German areas. Germany offers
                    monthly financial support to international students who are
                    willing and able to commit to working as a general
                    practitioner in a rural and medically understaffed area of
                    Germany for a specified number of years. One of these
                    organisations that offers such financial support is the
                    “Meilenstein-Emsland” foundation. This organisation sponsors
                    students who agree to work in the German Emsland region
                    after they graduate from their program. There are also many
                    other programs for other areas so be sure to look into them
                    if you want to study medicine in Germany and need financial
                    support to do so!
