                <h1>1. Communication</h1>
                <p style={{ color: '#696969', fontSize: '14px' }}>

                    Always listen to understand rather than to speak. This is because if you understand people, you’ll
                    be able to communicate better. You can find out what they need and provide it for them.

                    need to be patient, empathetic and responsive.

                    lients who are angry or upset with grace. You must also be savvy and solve problems quickly to satisfy them.
