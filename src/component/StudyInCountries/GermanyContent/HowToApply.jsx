            <h2 className='header'>How to apply - Germany</h2>
            <span>After learning how to acquire your student visa, you’ll want to learn how to apply to university programs in Germany. Germany has some of the most prestigious study programs with a wide variety of subjects to choose from, so you’ll indeed find a great study program at a university perfect for you. Read on to learn more about this.</span>

                <h2>Find your Study degree and university
                </h2>
                <span>
                    You should start researching at least three months before you decide to apply for the university to
                    find the perfect study degree and institution where you intend to pursue the degree. This is the first and perhaps most crucial step when applying for university in Germany. It won’t be hard to find a great program as there are many good universities and programs with any specialisation you would love to study that will take you in the direction you want to go after graduation.

            <div>
                <span>However, because there are so many options available, narrowing things down might take some time, especially if you haven’t looked into study programs before. First, it might help to choose the city you want to live in and then start searching the universities and degree programs there. It’s better to apply to more than one university at once to have a higher chance of being accepted into one.

            </div>

            <div>
                <span>Making a list of the universities and study degree programs is the first step that determines the rest of your application process.

                <h2 >Make sure you are eligible</h2>
                <span>
                    Once you have decided on your list of universities and study programs, you should check the deadlines for the applications and the requirements to be eligible for the university and the study program. It’s best to check these at least two weeks before the application is opened to start submitting it so you don’t run short on time.

            <div>

                <span>
                    You can find out if you are eligible or not by looking into the university website and checking the admission requirements. If you are confused about what is meant by a requirement, reach out to the university through their email or phone number or directly in the Contact Us section on their website.

            <div>

                <span>
                    You will find different requirements for each program and for each university, so be sure to list them, especially if you are applying to several universities. This is so that you don’t miss anything or get them mixed up. Missing documents or sending incorrect ones can cause your application to be delayed or even cancelled, so double-check everything before submitting them.

            </div>

          <div>
          <span>Examples of these documents typically requested by most institutions are certified copies of previous degrees like high school diplomas or bachelor’s degrees and other related qualifications, language proficiency proofs depending on the language of the degree you’re applying for and an overview of previous grades. You’ll also be asked for passport photos and a copy of your passport or another official identification document.

                <span>When it comes to language proficiency proof, it differs based on the language you are going to study in. If you will study in German, you’ll need to present one of the recognised German language certificates to prove your level, such as the TestDaF level IV, DSH Certificate II or III,

                <h2>Fill out your application</h2>
                <span>Once you have completed your requirements, the next step is to fill out your application. You should double-check your documents before submitting them and make sure
                    you don’t have to send them by post or have someone in Germany hand them in for you in person, as some universities request this instead of online applications.
                </span>
            </div>

            <div>

                <span>

                    Most German universities use a system called UniAssist that you submit your application through. Some universities also run their own online application on their website.

            <div>

                <span>
                    Try to submit your application as soon as possible as so many international students choose Germany as a study abroad destination, so the university servers are often flooded with applications. Submit as early as possible and then wait for the university to contact you about the next step.

                <h2>Learn German (If Possible)

                    <span>The next step when applying for university admission in Germany is an optional one but one that is highly recommended and is learning the German
                        language. You can expect to get to a pretty good level if you start learning it around six months before applying. Even if your program is in English
                        , it’s recommended to learn German or at least basic skills. This is because in lectures, even in English programs, professors and students may converse
                        in German, and you don’t want to miss out on information, even non-official lecture information. Germans are also more comfortable expressing themselves
                        in German, so trying to meet them halfway can have benefits and earn you points.

                    </span>
                </h2>
            </div>

          <div>
          <span>In general, if you are going to study for an undergraduate degree, it’s more crucial to know German as most degrees are taught in it. On the other hand, you may find more English-based programs at the master’s and PhD levels. However, learning German can also help you deal with locals and go about your daily life more smoothly, as many people such as those who offer services don’t speak English. That means you’ll need at least a little bit of German under your belt to be able to interact with them.

                <h2>Enroll at the University</h2>
                <span>The final step in the process happens after you arrive in Germany. This is the enrollment into the university so you can actually get a place in the degree.

            </div>

            <span>
                You will need to pay a registration fee of an average of 200 euros and also a semester ticket for public transportation for six months.
            </span>

            <div>
                <span>In order to enrol in your degree program, you’ll need to go to the international office of your institution and submit documents like your passport, passport photos, visa or residence permits and application form. You’ll also need to submit your original copies with degree qualifications and the letter of admission from the institution.

                </span>
            </div>

            <span>You will also be asked to hand in proof of your health insurance and the payment receipt with any paid fees.

            <div>
                <span>
                    After enrolling, you will be given an ID card or document that can be used for registration at the government office to acquire your residence permit. It’s important to note that you will need to register every semester at the same place, paying the exact enrollment costs for the semester.
