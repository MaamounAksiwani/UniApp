            <span>When it comes to living costs, it’s been said that the average amount you should put aside if you intend to study in Germany is from 7,000 to 10,000 euros yearly. These costs follow along with the average costs of living in any European country, so when it comes to living costs, Germany is typically not more expensive than other countries, nor is it cheaper. However, your monthly rent is considered your highest fixed cost. Read on to learn more about the different accommodation types available for international students and which would be the most suitable type for you.

                <span>
                    Talking about accommodation in Germany as an international student, you must consider which city you are moving to, as costs differ significantly between them.
                    For example, Berlin is one of the cheapest cities to live in as you can rent a one-bedroom apartment there for around 600 euros monthly.

            <div>
                <span>On the other hand, Munich is more expensive than Berlin because it is a safe and stable city with a strong economy. If you are searching for accommodation
                    in Munich, you probably won’t be able to find a one-bedroom flat for less than 1,000 euros per month, and that is considering a relatively cheap apartment.

                    Frankfurt is also an expensive city to live in, second place in costs to Munich. You can pay around 900 euros per month for a one-bedroom flat there. Cologne another famous student city is less expensive than Munich or Frankfurt but is still more expensive than living in Berlin. You can expect to pay around 800 euros monthly for a one-bedroom house there in Cologne.

                    However, there are always different types of student accommodations available that come at lower costs than renting private residences. You can learn more about these accommodations in the next section.

                <h2 className='header'>Student Dormitories
                </h2>
                <span>
                    The most popular student accommodations in Germany are those in student dormitories, known there as residence halls. Around 40 per cent of all international students studying abroad in Germany decide to live in this type of accommodation. These are some of the most affordable types of accommodation available out there.

                They have typically shared buildings designed with students in mind. You may have to share a bathroom or at the very least a kitchen and common area. A plus to living in one of those dorms is exposure to many international students, an excellent opportunity to make good friends.

                <span>Student dormitories differ from one German city to another, such as building size, room design and size and the furniture available in the dorm room.

            </div>


            <div>
                <span>These student dorms are typically located close to universities, which is another advantage and the reasonable price. International students living in student residences pay around 250 euros monthly, depending on amenities and services available with the room.

            </div>


            <div>
                <span>Another option to keep in mind is housing entities’ private dormitory options. Still, these are often more expensive than student dormitories, as they tend to include more services and may offer a bit more privacy with mini kitchenettes and bathrooms in each of the rooms.

                <h2 className='header'>Wohngemeinschaft “WG” – Shared Flats
                </h2>
                <span>
                    Shared flats, also called flatshares, are known in Germany by the abbreviation “WG” and are popular among international students as an accommodation option. Some people decide to stay there when they can’t find a flat in a university dorm.
                </span>
            </div>



            <div>
                <span>These accommodation options are private apartments rented by students and shared with their peers, usually four others. Each flatmate has their own room and shares a kitchen, bathroom and common leisure area with their other flat partners. They also split the cost of rent and utilities among them.

            <div>
                <span>
                    For example, if you decide to rent a three-bedroom flat with a monthly cost of 1,300 euros, each one will pay around 400 euros per month and the utilities.

            <div>
                <h2 className='header'>Private rentals </h2>
                <span>Another housing option in Germany for international students is private rentals. These are accommodation options for students who would like to live alone and crave privacy.


                </span>
            </div>

            <div>
                <span>Unfortunately, this is one of Germany’s most expensive types of housing options. This is because you’ll have to pay the cost of both rent and utilities on your own watch. That means that you’ll pay rent anywhere from 500 to over 1000 euros per month depending on the city and where the apartment is located.

                <h2 className='header'>Short-Stay Accommodation
                </h2>
                <span>Finally, short-stay accommodations are also an option for those who will stay in Germany for only a short while. You could also choose to stay at these whilst looking for the perfect long term accommodation.


                </span>
            </div>

          <div>
          <span>
                Options for these short-stay accommodations include renting a room in a hostel, renting a shared room in a hostel or renting a room in a Bed and Breakfast. You could also rent a room using Airbnb or rent a couch in someone’s house using Couchsurfer.

                </h2>

                <span>Regarding other living costs besides accommodation in Germany, you can expect to pay utilities of around 200 euros, including internet, mobile packages and TV subscriptions. You should also expect to pay around 200 euros for groceries a month and about 100 euros of health insurance on your student health insurance plan.
