                After learning about the study abroad process in Germany and how to acquire a student visa and apply to universities, you may be interested in learning about scholarships. Many scholarships and study grants are available for those who want to study in Germany.

            <div>
                <span>
                    Most of these scholarships come from civil society organisations associated with political or religious parties or unions. These associations receive their funds through the German government under the scheme of the talent support funds (in German, this is called the Begabtenförderungswerke).

            <div>


                <span>
                    The entity that sponsors the most scholarships is the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), a group of German universities and student bodies to make the German higher education system more international through streamlining exchange systems.

                <h2>What do I need to apply for a scholarship?</h2>
                <span>
                    Every scholarship is different, and there are additional requirements for each one. Still, in general, you can expect to hand in a letter of motivation, your CV, recommendation letters, your previous grades and the application form for the scholarship itself.

                <h2>Government-funded scholarships </h2>
                <span>

                    Examples of government-funded scholarships are those by the DAAD that offer students bachelor, master and PhD level scholarships. You can find them in the DAAD scholarships database.

          <div>
          <span>In this case, you’ll need to prepare documents like the online application form through the DAAD website, your CV, research proposal or motivation letter, letter of admission from the institution and previous university degrees if you are going for a post-graduate scholarship. You’ll also need to hand in previous transcripts from high school or your bachelor’s and the DAAD language evaluation form (for English and for some degrees, also for German). According to the scholarship, you may also need letters of reference or reference forms.
