            <span>
                After learning how to get your student visa, it’s essential to also learn how to apply to the institution of your choice. The application process to the institution you want to apply to differs based on your nationality and the type of school you are applying to, whether technological school, public university or grandes écoles.

                <span>
                    One of the most critical questions some international students may ask when applying to french universities is whether they can study in English or not. To answer the question, it is possible, although it isn’t widespread. Many good universities have English taught programs, so you can always apply to them if you don’t know French. Most of them will offer you French language courses to teach you the language while staying there to deal more quickly.

                    If you are a Non-EU student, then you apply through the online application process that was previously called CEF and is now called ‘Studying in France Procedure’. When you apply through this technique, you also get the chance to apply for your student visa on the internet. You will also be able to track your application and see its progress.
