                <h2>Accomodation </h2>
                <span>
                    For international students in France, they have several options for accommodation.

                <h2 className='header'>Student Residence Halls</h2>
                <span>
                    Students tend to go for the first option is the student residence halls, or “cites U”. These rooms are managed by the Regional Centres of University and Academic Services. Around 15 per cent of international students studying in France tend to choose this type of accommodation, as it’s easier for students who have never studied abroad.

                <div>
                    <span>
                        As this is typically the cheapest kind of accommodation, you can expect to pay an average of 250 dollars per month, or around 450 dollars if you live in Paris.

                <span>
                Apart from the Cites U, there are also private student residences where room rental is a bit more expensive. This is because they tend to have more services available for those renting there, such as a good laundry room, internet services and an onsite gym and study rooms, among other benefits.

                <h2>Private Rentals </h2>
                <span>
                Another option for students is private flats or room rentals. You can either rent a room alone or if you choose to lower your expenses, you can share with a roommate or several. You can also make lifelong friendships with your roommates. When it comes to services offered, these rooms are either furnished or unfurnished and may include utilities or may not, so be sure to check the lease before agreeing, so you know exactly what you are getting yourself into.

                In general, you will pay between 450 and 750 dollars per month in most french cities while it will cost a bit more in Paris (up to 850 dollars per month). You can probably find a small apartment in smaller French towns for around 350 dollars monthly.

                <span>
                If you live with family members, either a spouse or children, you will pay a bit more as you’ll need more than a one-bedroom apartment. In this case, you can expect to pay from 750 to 1,500 dollars per month, and it could be more expensive if you decide to live in the town or city centre.

                <span>
                A popular option for experiencing the fascinating French culture is staying with a host family. In addition to improving your French and getting an irreplaceable daily opportunity to practice your language skills, staying with a host family is cheaper than the other accommodation options. In most cases, they will offer you a private room in their house or apartment.

                Some hosts even offer you a room for free or a meagre rate in exchange for help around the house, such as babysitting, house chores or cooking. Some might even do it in exchange for learning your language, as a language tandem exchange.
