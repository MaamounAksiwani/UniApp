                Speaking of the baguette, when you head out to France, you’d better not turn it upside down on a table, as the French believe this can cause you years and years of bad luck. This belief started in the Middle Ages, relating to executioners who would perform capital punishment.

                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <span>
                One of the unique things about France is the French language. French is the official and 
                national language in France, so studying there is the perfect opportunity to learn, or improve, your french.

                But be careful when you try speaking with locals as French is one of the languages in the world with the most homophones, words sharing the same pronunciation but spelt differently and with different meanings.

                For example, try not to say “As-tu vu le vert ver allant vers le Verre en Verre vert ?” (“Did you see the green worm going towards the green glass glass?”) as this can really cause you to get your tongue in a twist.
