                Suppose you’re excited about studying abroad in France after reading all about the great universities there. In that case, you will need to learn about the study visa process, as most students require a student visa to be able to study in the country. Before learning about the visa process, you should consider whether you actually need one or not, as some students won’t require one to study in France.

                <h2>Do I need a study visa? </h2>
                <span>
                    Whether you need a visa or not is based more or less on whether you are an EU citizen or not. EU citizens or citizens of EEA, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein don’t need student visas to study in France. You’ll just need a passport or another valid form of an identification document to be able to sign up for university.

                <span>
                    When you are applying for a visa to study in France, several kinds are available based on how long you choose to study in France and what you need it for.

                <span>
                    If your study course takes less than three months to complete, you can apply for the court séjour pour étude, or the short-stay or Schengen student visa. This visa is free, but you can’t renew it again.

                <span>
                    If you are travelling to France to do an entrance exam for a university, you can simply issue an entrance exam visa. If you pass your university entrance exam, you will be allowed to apply for a one-year residence permit that you can later extend.

                    The visa de long séjour temporaire pour études, or the temporary permit, lets you stay in the country for up to half a year. If you get this visa, you won’t need to separately apply for a residence permit.

                <span>The final type of visa is the long term visa, known as the visa de long séjour pour études, which
                    is the one you’ll need if you want to study in France for longer than six months at a time. This visa has a
                    double function as a residence permit and is usually valid for the time of your study period, from two to four years, based on your degree type.

                Algerian students won’t require this extended visa. Still, they will need to contact the institution or the French consulate in Algeria to find out what regulations are in place specific to them.

                <h2>How to apply for a visa </h2>
                <span>
                When you have become accepted into a program at a French university, you’ll be able to apply for a student visa. To apply for the visa, you should reach out to the embassy of France in your country and ask them how to apply.

                <span>
                In general, you’ll need to present several documents. From these documents is the official acceptance letter from the university you applied to, with an official header that has the full study details, including start and end dates. You’ll also need to provide evidence that you have enough money to support yourself while studying at the university, about 800 dollars per month. This proof can be presented as a bank statement, scholarship acceptance letter or loan notice that shows funding.



                </span>
            </div>



            <div>
                <span>
                You will also need to prove that you will go back to your home country, often as a plane ticket back home booked. You could also present a handwritten statement that has the dates you intend to leave France on. You will also be required to show proof of medical insurance, with a value of at least 40,000 USD dollars as a cover.

                <span>
                Another document to be presented is any confirmation of where you will be staying, whether a student housing confirmation or a rent agreement or ‘attestation d’accueil’, if you’ll stay with friends or family members. You should also show proof of French language proficiency if you join a degree course in the French language.

                <h2>Steps after arrival in France </h2>

                <span>
                If you are awarded an extended-stay visa, you’ll need to send your official visa, along with the official form you received, to the French Office of Immigration and Integration. You can send it by registered mail to Paris, or you can hand it in in person if you are going to live in the capital city. You’ll need to pay a tax of around 80 dollars for these admin costs to get everything done. 



                </span>
            </div>



            <div>
    

                <span>
                With the same documents, you’ll need to present a copy of your passport documents, with the pages with your entry stamp into France and your identity documents as essential pages to be sent.

                </span>
            </div>


            <div>
              

                <span>
                Once the office has received your documents, they’ll send you the confirmation document and further steps if you need to do so. Your university can help you finish the rest of the process, and you can often submit additional documents to your school if they have an agreement sent. For example, other documents you may be asked for could be to have a medical examination done if you haven’t already done one.
