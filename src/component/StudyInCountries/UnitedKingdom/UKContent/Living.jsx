                    around 1,500 euros per study month, though this may be lower
                    if you live outside of London, or higher if you live in
                    London. Besides accommodation costs, you’ll also need to
                    factor in other costs of living so make sure you look at the
                    entire picture when making a decision on how much to set
                    aside for living costs. Read on to learn more about exactly
                    how much you’ll need to live in the UK while studying

                    shared apartments to homestays. As usual, accommodation
                    takes up the biggest part of living costs. That’s why it’s
                    important to be smart when choosing a place to live that you
                    can afford and that will suit your needs.&nbsp;</span

                    halls are typically well priced and offer you a room, as
                    well as utilities included within the costs. First-year
                    students tend to prefer this accommodation option until they
                    get used to living in the UK and are able to head out on

                  <span style={{fontWeight:'400'}}
                    >Another option for students that is popular is renting a
                    private apartment. These apartments can be shared among
                    several students to reduce costs, with each student
                    receiving a separate room or having a room with a roommate.
                    Rent varies greatly in this case and you can find yourself
                    paying from 10 euros to 800 euros per month.&nbsp;</span

                    around 750 euros. If you rent out an entire flat with
                    multiple bedrooms, you will probably pay from 300 to 1,500
                    euros per month depending on size, location and

                    same area. You will pay anywhere from 400 euros to 8,000
                    euros per month, based on the size, where the apartment is
                    and the services that come along with it.&nbsp;</span

                    semester, this can be a good way to immerse yourself in
                    British culture and get a more hands-on experience, as
                    you’ll be able to share their daily lives and

                    private room, food and utilities. If you choose this

                    electricity. Most students also spend an average of 200
                    euros on groceries per month and higher if you tend to eat
                    out a lot. If you want to have a TV, you’ll need to pay
