                    need to first apply to the university and get an acceptance
                    letter, much like many other European countries and the
                    system that works there. You will need this letter of
                    acceptance to start your student visa application. Read on

                    there. You should look into the regulations about how to

                    also need to support yourself financially and have proof

                    than 18 years, you will need to have permission from the
