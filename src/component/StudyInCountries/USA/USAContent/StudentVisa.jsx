                    >In order to study in the USA, all international students
                    need a study visa, unless they have US citizenship or
                    permanent residence. This study visa lets international
                    students stay in the US temporarily and study at their
                    school of choice. In general, your visa ends when you
                    graduate from your program so in this case, you have to
                    leave directly when you complete your program unless you
                    extend your visa or apply for another one, such as a work
                    visa. Read on to learn more about the different kinds of
                    student visas and how to apply for one to study in the
                    US.&nbsp;</span

                    >There are three types of study visas for those who want to
                    study in the US in full-time study programs, that are longer
                    than one or two semesters. The F1 visa applies to both
                    undergraduate and postgraduate students and is the most
                    common type of study visa for those wanting to study in the
                    US, including those who want to take language
                    programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span

                    pursue non-academic study in the US. These degree programs
                    are shorter than the F1 visa programs and are more
                    professionally focused. For example, culinary school courses
                    or medical training programs need this type of visa if
                    students want to study them.&nbsp;</span

                    abroad students and au pairs, among other exchange visitors.
                    These are for shorter time periods than the F1 visa, for
                    example, if you are studying abroad for only a semester or
                    two.&nbsp;</span

                    requirements like a valid passport, passport photos and
                    financial resources. For example, when it comes to money,
                    you’ll need a fee called the I-901 SEVIS fee which is 350
                    USD for F1 or M1 visas and 220 USD for J1 students. They
                    also offer visa fees of 35 USD for those who enter short J2
                    programs. All students must pay an additional visa
                    processing fee of 160 dollars. Some nationalities may also
                    need to pay extra visa issuance fees, so be sure to check
                    for your specific nationality when applying for your
                    visa.&nbsp;</span
