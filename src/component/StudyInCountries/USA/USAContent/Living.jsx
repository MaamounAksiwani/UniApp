                <h2>On-Campus Student Accommodation</h2>
                <span>
                    Perhaps the most popular type of student accommodation among freshmen, on-campus student accommodations are among the most affordable options there. Because they are located on campus, students pay minimum transportation costs and typically, the rent of these rooms is cheaper than other living accommodations rental. If international students choose this living option, they will typically live in shared dorms on campus.

                    There are typically up to five students living in each shared dorm and you can choose the dorm you live in, though sometimes you can’t always choose your roommates. There are often options for food in on-campus dining halls and you can pay an additional cost to have meal plans set up if you’d rather eat in the campus cafeteria rather than make your own food.

                <span>
                    Another popular accommodation option is the homestay option. This is a type of living arrangement where students live with a family. They typically receive a private room but are expected to help out with family meals and activities if they are staying there. They also pay a minimal rent fee and may be asked to pay another fee up-front, depending on the host family. If they do chores, they may get a discount on their rent.

                    On average, if you choose this accommodation option, you should expect to pay around $600 per month for an accommodation fee and extra fees up to 300 dollars, if the host family asks you to pay them.

                <h2>Private Rentals </h2>
                <span>
                    Private rentals are another accommodation option that many international students choose. They might either rent a studio or one-bedroom apartment or rent an apartment to share with friends or family members and split the cost between them. Renting a private apartment gives a higher level of privacy than the previous accommodation options but the problem is that you’ll have to finance everything from the bills to buying groceries to looking after your own apartment if something goes wrong.

                    If you rent a room in a shared apartment, you’ll typically share a kitchen, bathroom and living room and get your own private bedroom. You can also choose to sublet your room while renting if you go away so that you can save the rent costs or make some extra money.

            <div>
                <span>
                    How much you pay for rent depends on the location, apartment size and amenities and services that come along with the apartment. You can typically expect to pay anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 dollars per month, with rentals in cities like New York being the most expensive while those in areas like San Francisco being a bit on the cheaper side.

                </h2>
                <span>
                    During the process of finding a place to live, or shifting from one place to another, many students choose to stay at student hostels. While it isn’t a practical option to stay there for a long time period, many students choose these as a buffer and a temporary home till they get themselves sorted. They typically have secure lockers and dining facilities for students and other travellers, but be sure to look into the safety and reputation of the hostel you choose through checking reviews before going there.

                <h2>Other costs of living</h2>
                <span>When it comes to other living costs, students should set aside from 900 to 2000 dollars yearly for books and study materials. They should also expect to pay around 20 dollars per month for electricity and
                    30 dollars for internet and international calls. Cell Phone bills will cost students an average of 50 dollars per month. </span>

                    Food will cost students around 150 dollars per month for groceries. However, the cost can go up if students choose to eat out often, so those who want to save money should try to limit going out for food as this can quickly rack up costs, no matter how tempting it may seem.
