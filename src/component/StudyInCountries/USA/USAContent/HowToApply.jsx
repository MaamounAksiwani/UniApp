                    in the US, whether graduate or undergraduate courses, you’ll
                    be interested in how to apply to the universities. The
                    first, and most obvious, step when applying to your
                    university of choice is to choose the degree program you
                    wish to study and select the university that you wish to
                    study at. It’s recommended that you choose several
                    universities and study program options to apply to so you
                    have a higher chance of being accepted.&nbsp;</span

                    TOEFL iBT (Test of English as a Foreign Language) exam, the
