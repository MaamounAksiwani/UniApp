                cultural diversity to world-class institutions that offer any major under the sun, with many specialisations
                that don’t exist in any other country, international students love going to the land of the American Dream to
                learn and pursue their professional careers there after graduation. Read on to learn more about why you should study in the US and how much it will cost you to do so.

                <h2>Why should you study in the USA?</h2>
                <span>
                    There are many reasons why students choose the USA as a study destination. The next section talks about the reasons in detail, just in case you need convincing as to why you should look into studying abroad there.

                <h2 className='header'>Cultural Diversity</h2>
                <span>
                    One of the main reasons many students decide to study abroad in the United States is the cultural diversity there. Every university in the US states that cultural diversity is one of their main values and are always trying to increase the number of international students taken in every year and giving international students many educational opportunities to study there and enrol into the universities.

                <span>
                    International students who choose to study there also always comment on the fact that there are so many other international students in their classes and dorms. They find students from every culture, religion and nationality and are able to interact with them and have an educational experience that is multicultural and thrilling because of those interactions.

                <h2 className='header'>Excellent support facilities</h2>
                <span>
                    Another good reason to study in the US, besides the excellent universities, is the great support facilities offered to students who go to study there. Many universities offer many programs to help ease the transition into the university, from workshops to English language courses and exchanges to orientations to extracurriculars and campus activities. International students are given plenty of support to get them ready to join the university and be ready to fully participate and excel in their courses.

                    Studying in the US also gives international students an easy access pass to stay there after graduation and work there at some of the biggest and most well-known companies worldwide. For example, graduates of the STEM fields (which are Science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are sometimes offered two years after graduation to gain work experience and potentially extend their stay.

                <h2>Many degree subject options</h2>
                <span>
                    The fact that you can study any subject you can think of, even ones you didn’t think possible, is yet another reason why people decide to choose the US as a study abroad destination. From studying computer science to flourish into the next Steve Jobs to studying international relations and becoming the next Barack Obama to studying engineering and turning into the next Elon Musk, the options are endless. You can pick a specialisation that you are passionate about and become an expert in your field, then decide to pursue it in the US or bring your talents back to your home country and make a difference there.

                <h2>Learning self-reliance</h2>
                <span>
                    Learning to be independent and self-reliant is also a reason why students decide to pursue their study abroad journeys in America. Studying abroad helps people become more motivated, diverse and independent than those who never took the chance. Being among people who are flexible and self-reliant such as Americans helps international students grow into these qualities and become more outgoing and communicative.

                <h2>Great career and research opportunities</h2>
                <span>
                    Finally, one of the main reasons international students choose to study abroad in the US is the great career opportunities after graduation and also the opportunities to participate in groundbreaking research. Studying there helps introduce you to a world of great companies where you can create connections through your education. Studying at a great university will widen your scope and allow you to become eligible for many career opportunities.

                    US institutions also allow students to conduct research in many areas of study and receive great training opportunities. Many international students choose to become teaching assistants or research assistants to be able to dive more deeply into their subjects of choice. This can also help them fund their degrees, or make some cash on the side. Working with professors also lets them work with the best minds in the field and learn from them, broadening their skills and professional knowledge in the area.

                <h2>Option for Community Colleges </h2>
                <span>
                    A final reason to choose to study in the USA is the option for community colleges. These colleges are an affordable option as they have cheaper tuition fees than other universities and are easier to be accepted into. They also have partnerships with many top ranked universities so if you don’t get admitted into a university, you can join the community college for a 2 year period and then 
                    continue your studies at the university of your dreams. This 2 year period of often called an “associate’s degree”.

              <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
              <span>When talking about the cost of studying in the US, universities are split into two sectors- state and private. If you study at a state university, you will nepay less than if you study at a
                 private university. The degree you have chosen also determines how much you will pay, as some majors cost more than others do. </span>
            </div>

            <div>

                <span>
                In general, to be able to pay your tuition fees, you will need to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $55,000 per year. If you are going for English language studies, your tuition will cost you from $700 to $2,000 a month. Tuition fees at community colleges cost students there from $6,000 to $20,000 annually.

                Undergraduate bachelor’s programs cost international students from $20,000 to $40,000 per year while graduate degrees 



                </span>

            </div>


            <div>
                <span>cost from $20,000 to $45,000 yearly. Programs like MBAs and other medical programs and those in law and some areas of engineering may cost way more than this estimated cost so be sure to look into the cost of your individual program if you are looking to pursue a professional degree program.

            <div>
                <span>
                If you’re intending to pursue a PhD or Doctoral Degree, you can expect to pay a range of $28,000 to $55,000 per year, though some doctorate programs are fully funded when you become a research or teaching assistant or apply for research aid or bursaries. However, it’s important to note that getting a fellowship or working as a teaching or research assistant can be hard to land as universities tend to give priority to US citizens, rather than international students. Thankfully, building a good repertoire and relationship with the PhD department of your choice and professors who work there can give you a good chance to get a fellowship or position as a research or teaching assistant.
