                    years to complete, with the first two years having more
                    theoretical courses that are more general, so they can

                    fast track programs where students can finish their study
                    degrees in only one year.&nbsp; Master’s degrees are
                    typically split into Academic and professional master’s
                    programs. Professional master’s programs are called terminal
                    programs and focus more on preparing for employment rather
                    than for future studies. Academic master’s degrees, on the
                    other hand, prepare students to go on to pursue a doctoral
