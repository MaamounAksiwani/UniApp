                    <h1>What is a Bachelor’s Degree?</h1>

                    <span>
                        A bachelor’s degree is an undergraduate degree that
                        students choose to


                        study at a university. It is
                        known as the most basic university degree. Getting
                        this degree can allow you to learn and grow and give
                        you access to many job opportunities. Bachelor’s
                        degrees usually take about four years to complete,
                        give or take, depending on the subject you have
                        chosen and the country you are studying in. For
                        example, in the United States, they take around four years to complete and amount to about 120
                        credit hours. Students choose from many subjects to study, such as psychology, nursing, business or computer science, based on what they are passionate about. There are online and in-person university bachelor’s degrees, though online degrees are increasing in popularity nowadays too.

                    <h1>Types of Bachelor’s degrees </h1>

                    <span>
                        There are several types of bachelor’s degrees, from the Bachelor of Arts (B.A) degrees to the Bachelor of Sciences degrees, so it’s important to
                        understand what each one is if you are applying for a degree. Here are some of the most popular types of bachelor’s degrees:

                    <span>
                        The Bachelor of Arts degree is for students who want to study a program in the liberal arts or humanities and social sciences fields,
                        such as economics, literature or history. However, they do include some maths and sciences courses, especially if you are in a liberal
                        arts school that gives a more well-rounded education. In general, however, a bachelor of arts degree is more theoretical than a bachelor’s of
                        science. The only exception to this rule is in the United Kingdom, as there a bachelor’s of arts degree includes all fields of study, even scientific subjects.

                    <span>
                        On the other hand, a Bachelor’s of science (B.Sc.) degree is another undergraduate degree that combines theoretical knowledge and practical research. Students who choose to study this type of bachelor’s degree study subjects in Natural Sciences, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics. In some cases, some kinds of degrees that are typically Bachelor’s of arts degrees, such as Business and Economics degrees, may also be bachelor’s of science if they have a research-heavy focus.

                    <span>
                        A Bachelor’s of Applied Science (BAS) degree is a course that has many practical applications like a Nursing bachelor’s degree. That means the degree is more practical than theoretical. In Canada and the Netherlands, a Bachelor’s of Applied Science degree is a professional degree and can be equal to a Bachelor’s Engineering degree. A Bachelor’s of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree is a bachelor’s degree that focuses on an engineering subject. In general, these degrees take
                        from 3 to 5 years to be completed. These degrees are equal to bachelor’s of science degrees and have many areas for specialisation.

                    <h1>Benefits of studying a bachelor’s degree
                    </h1>
                    <span>
                        After learning about the different kinds of bachelor’s degrees, you might be asking yourself why you should even study a
                        bachelor’s degree. Here are some of the reasons students choose to study a bachelor’s degree, rather than forego it:
                    </span>
                </div>



                <div className='degreesContact'>
                    <h2>Higher pay and better jobs </h2>
                    <span>The first benefit to studying a bachelor’s degree is getting jobs with higher pay than what you could have gotten without it.
                        College graduates make more money than those who simply have a high school degree, even while working the same position.
                        You can also get better jobs, as well as be eligible for more jobs, as most jobs actually require a bachelor’s degree as a
                        prerequisite. Some jobs that require a bachelor’s degree are nurses, financial managers, mental health counselers, project
                        managers, marketing specialists and many, many more.
                    </span>
                </div>


                <div className='degreesContact'>
                    <h2>Impress employers
                    </h2>
                    <span>Adding to the previous point, employers are more likely to hire people with a bachelor’s degree
                        as they consider them more knowledgeable than those without. Employers want people who are prepared to
                        work and have the necessary foundation knowledge, as well as hard workers. Whether you study a bachelor’s in
                        arts or sciences, you can bet your employer will be more impressed and more likely to hire you with a bachelor’s degree as it means you more likely than not have the previous qualities.

                <div className='degreesContact'>
                    <h2>Networking opportunities

                    </h2>
                    <span>
                        Another reason why you should pursue a bachelor’s degree is the networking opportunities. When you attend classes, you have many chances to network with professors, students and professionals in your field of study who give guest lectures or sponsor projects. This can help you build a valuable network, learn about potential careers and get advice from mentors that can help you your whole career long.

                    <h2>Gain new skills

                    </h2>
                    <span>An advantage to earning a bachelor’s degree is gaining new skills and knowledge. For example, you’ll gain skills like critical thinking skills, creative skills and problem solving skills. You’ll also learn to communicate effectively, both written and verbally. These key skills will help you during the course of your career, and also help you to develop your personality.

                    </h2>
                    <span>
                        A bachelor’s degree is also a great chance to follow your passions and study a subject you are passionate about
                        . You’ll get to explore it both theoretically and practically and learn everything you could possibly want to learn. After pursuing
                        your bachelor’s degree in the subject, you might want to go on to pursue a master’s or PhD degree in the same area of passion if you
                        want to further develop your knowledge.
