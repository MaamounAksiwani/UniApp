                                            required for the purposes set out in
                                            this privacy policy. However, we may
                                            be required by law to retain your
                                            personal data for a longer period of
                                            time. These legal obligations may
                                            arise for accounting, auditing, or
                                            tax purposes, among others. The
                                            retention periods in Europe are
                                            generally between six and ten years.

                                            We may also restrict the processing
                                            of your data instead of deleting it
                                            if this is permitted or required by
                                            law. This applies in particular in
                                            cases where we still need the data
                                            for possible legal prosecution,
                                            legal defence or otherwise. The
                                            statutory limitation and retention
                                            periods are then decisive for the

                                            processing. The individual retention
                                            periods depend on the respective
                                            personal data, the applicable
                                            national law and the purposes for
                                            which we need them. After expiry of
                                            the relevant periods, the data will
                                            then be permanently deleted.

                                          Area (EEA). Only selected third
                                          parties will transfer the data. Some
                                          countries outside the EEA may have
